00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.796
How do you explain when things don't go as we assume?

2
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.796
Or better, how do you explain

3
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.796
when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions?

4
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.796
For example:

5
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.796
Why is Apple so innovative?

6
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.796
Year after year, after year,

7
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.796
they're more innovative than all their competition.

8
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.796
And yet, they're just a computer company.

9
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.796
They're just like everyone else.

10
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.010
They have the same access to the same talent,

11
00:00:39.034 --> 00:00:40.035
the same agencies,

12
00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:41.915
the same consultants, the same media.

13
00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:45.399
Then why is it that they seem to have something different?

14
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.796
Why is it that Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights Movement?

15
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.796
He wasn't the only man who suffered in pre-civil rights America,

16
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.565
and he certainly wasn't the only great orator of the day.

17
00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:58.796
Why him?

18
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.796
And why is it that the Wright brothers

19
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.796
were able to figure out controlled, powered man flight

20
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.970
when there were certainly other teams

21
00:01:06.994 --> 00:01:09.867
who were better qualified, better funded --

22
00:01:09.891 --> 00:01:12.796
and they didn't achieve powered man flight,

23
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.795
and the Wright brothers beat them to it.

24
00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:16.707
There's something else at play here.

25
00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:21.796
About three and a half years ago, I made a discovery.

26
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.796
And this discovery profoundly changed my view on how I thought the world worked,

27
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.820
and it even profoundly changed the way in which I operate in it.

28
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.796
As it turns out, there's a pattern.

29
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.796
As it turns out, all the great inspiring leaders and organizations in the world,

30
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.835
whether it's Apple or Martin Luther King or the Wright brothers,

31
00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:47.796
they all think, act and communicate the exact same way.

32
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.796
And it's the complete opposite to everyone else.

33
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.796
All I did was codify it,

34
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.796
and it's probably the world's simplest idea.

35
00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.820
I call it the golden circle.

36
00:02:08.116 --> 00:02:10.796
Why? How? What?

37
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.796
This little idea explains

38
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.796
why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren't.

39
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.796
Let me define the terms really quickly.

40
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.796
Every single person, every single organization on the planet

41
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.542
knows what they do, 100 percent.

42
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.796
Some know how they do it,

43
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.504
whether you call it your differentiated value proposition

44
00:02:30.528 --> 00:02:32.796
or your proprietary process or your USP.

45
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.567
But very, very few people or organizations know why they do what they do.

46
00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:39.796
And by "why" I don't mean "to make a profit."

47
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.796
That's a result. It's always a result.

48
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.796
By "why," I mean: What's your purpose?

49
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.259
What's your cause? What's your belief?

50
00:02:46.283 --> 00:02:49.796
Why does your organization exist?

51
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.188
Why do you get out of bed in the morning?

52
00:02:52.212 --> 00:02:54.796
And why should anyone care?

53
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.725
As a result, the way we think, we act,

54
00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:59.565
the way we communicate is from the outside in, it's obvious.

55
00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:02.280
We go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing.

56
00:03:02.304 --> 00:03:05.796
But the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations --

57
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.415
regardless of their size, regardless of their industry --

58
00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.565
all think, act and communicate from the inside out.

59
00:03:14.367 --> 00:03:15.796
Let me give you an example.

60
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.208
I use Apple because they're easy to understand and everybody gets it.

61
00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:21.803
If Apple were like everyone else,

62
00:03:21.827 --> 00:03:25.307
a marketing message from them might sound like this:

63
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:26.816
"We make great computers.

64
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.796
They're beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly.

65
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.109
Want to buy one?"

66
00:03:34.014 --> 00:03:35.015
"Meh."

67
00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:36.796
That's how most of us communicate.

68
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.308
That's how most marketing and sales are done,

69
00:03:39.332 --> 00:03:41.427
that's how we communicate interpersonally.

70
00:03:41.451 --> 00:03:43.222
We say what we do,

71
00:03:43.246 --> 00:03:45.015
we say how we're different or better

72
00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:46.896
and we expect some sort of a behavior,

73
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.896
a purchase, a vote, something like that.

74
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.196
Here's our new law firm:

75
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.642
We have the best lawyers with the biggest clients,

76
00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:54.288
we always perform for our clients.

77
00:03:54.312 --> 00:03:55.796
Here's our new car:

78
00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.452
It gets great gas mileage, it has leather seats.

79
00:03:58.476 --> 00:03:59.665
Buy our car.

80
00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:00.796
But it's uninspiring.

81
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.467
Here's how Apple actually communicates.

82
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.796
"Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo.

83
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.796
We believe in thinking differently.

84
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.251
The way we challenge the status quo

85
00:04:15.275 --> 00:04:17.796
is by making our products beautifully designed,

86
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.796
simple to use and user friendly.

87
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.459
We just happen to make great computers.

88
00:04:22.483 --> 00:04:23.537
Want to buy one?"

89
00:04:24.712 --> 00:04:26.015
Totally different, right?

90
00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:27.996
You're ready to buy a computer from me.

91
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.218
I just reversed the order of the information.

92
00:04:30.242 --> 00:04:34.114
What it proves to us is that people don't buy what you do;

93
00:04:34.138 --> 00:04:36.543
people buy why you do it.

94
00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:40.796
This explains why every single person in this room

95
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.796
is perfectly comfortable buying a computer from Apple.

96
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.796
But we're also perfectly comfortable

97
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.796
buying an MP3 player from Apple, or a phone from Apple,

98
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.797
or a DVR from Apple.

99
00:04:50.821 --> 00:04:53.348
As I said before, Apple's just a computer company.

100
00:04:53.372 --> 00:04:56.796
Nothing distinguishes them structurally from any of their competitors.

101
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.268
Their competitors are equally qualified to make all of these products.

102
00:05:00.292 --> 00:05:01.796
In fact, they tried.

103
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.796
A few years ago, Gateway came out with flat-screen TVs.

104
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.249
They're eminently qualified to make flat-screen TVs.

105
00:05:07.273 --> 00:05:09.796
They've been making flat-screen monitors for years.

106
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.393
Nobody bought one.

107
00:05:14.477 --> 00:05:19.796
Dell came out with MP3 players and PDAs,

108
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.796
and they make great quality products,

109
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.796
and they can make perfectly well-designed products --

110
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.620
and nobody bought one.

111
00:05:26.644 --> 00:05:29.096
In fact, talking about it now, we can't even imagine

112
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.668
buying an MP3 player from Dell.

113
00:05:30.692 --> 00:05:32.896
Why would you buy one from a computer company?

114
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.517
But we do it every day.

115
00:05:34.541 --> 00:05:37.032
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.

116
00:05:37.056 --> 00:05:42.581
The goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have.

117
00:05:42.605 --> 00:05:46.668
The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe.

118
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.447
Here's the best part:

119
00:05:49.471 --> 00:05:51.796
None of what I'm telling you is my opinion.

120
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.796
It's all grounded in the tenets of biology.

121
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.796
Not psychology, biology.

122
00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.559
If you look at a cross-section of the human brain,

123
00:05:59.583 --> 00:06:02.216
from the top down, the human brain is actually broken

124
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.796
into three major components

125
00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.796
that correlate perfectly with the golden circle.

126
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.796
Our newest brain, our Homo sapien brain,

127
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.796
our neocortex,

128
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.796
corresponds with the "what" level.

129
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.796
The neocortex is responsible

130
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.796
for all of our rational and analytical thought and language.

131
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.796
The middle two sections make up our limbic brains,

132
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.796
and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings,

133
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.796
like trust and loyalty.

134
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.963
It's also responsible for all human behavior,

135
00:06:30.987 --> 00:06:32.796
all decision-making,

136
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.796
and it has no capacity for language.

137
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.796
In other words, when we communicate from the outside in,

138
00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.963
yes, people can understand vast amounts of complicated information

139
00:06:41.987 --> 00:06:44.796
like features and benefits and facts and figures.

140
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.796
It just doesn't drive behavior.

141
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.916
When we can communicate from the inside out,

142
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.179
we're talking directly to the part of the brain

143
00:06:51.203 --> 00:06:52.796
that controls behavior,

144
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.796
and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do.

145
00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.370
This is where gut decisions come from.

146
00:06:59.394 --> 00:07:02.796
Sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures,

147
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.542
and they say, "I know what all the facts and details say,

148
00:07:05.566 --> 00:07:07.096
but it just doesn't feel right."

149
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.660
Why would we use that verb, it doesn't "feel" right?

150
00:07:09.684 --> 00:07:12.459
Because the part of the brain that controls decision-making

151
00:07:12.483 --> 00:07:13.796
doesn't control language.

152
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.281
The best we can muster up is,

153
00:07:15.305 --> 00:07:17.358
"I don't know.  It just doesn't feel right."

154
00:07:17.382 --> 00:07:20.796
Or sometimes you say you're leading with your heart or soul.

155
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.492
I hate to break it to you, those aren't other body parts

156
00:07:23.516 --> 00:07:24.796
controlling your behavior.

157
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.963
It's all happening here in your limbic brain,

158
00:07:26.987 --> 00:07:30.273
the part of the brain that controls decision-making and not language.

159
00:07:30.297 --> 00:07:32.796
But if you don't know why you do what you do,

160
00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.796
and people respond to why you do what you do,

161
00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.796
then how will you ever get people

162
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.868
to vote for you, or buy something from you,

163
00:07:40.892 --> 00:07:42.796
or, more importantly, be loyal

164
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.796
and want to be a part of what it is that you do.

165
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.870
The goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have;

166
00:07:48.894 --> 00:07:51.796
the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe.

167
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.796
The goal is not just to hire people who need a job;

168
00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.796
it's to hire people who believe what you believe.

169
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.940
I always say that, you know,

170
00:08:00.964 --> 00:08:06.796
if you hire people just because they can do a job, they'll work for your money,

171
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.611
but if they believe what you believe,

172
00:08:08.635 --> 00:08:11.070
they'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears.

173
00:08:11.094 --> 00:08:14.796
Nowhere else is there a better example than with the Wright brothers.

174
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:18.434
Most people don't know about Samuel Pierpont Langley.

175
00:08:18.458 --> 00:08:20.796
And back in the early 20th century,

176
00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.963
the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day.

177
00:08:23.987 --> 00:08:25.796
Everybody was trying it.

178
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.796
And Samuel Pierpont Langley had, what we assume,

179
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.493
to be the recipe for success.

180
00:08:31.517 --> 00:08:33.216
Even now, you ask people,

181
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.859
"Why did your product or why did your company fail?"

182
00:08:35.883 --> 00:08:38.144
and people always give you the same permutation

183
00:08:38.168 --> 00:08:39.589
of the same three things:

184
00:08:39.613 --> 00:08:42.590
under-capitalized, the wrong people, bad market conditions.

185
00:08:42.614 --> 00:08:45.425
It's always the same three things, so let's explore that.

186
00:08:46.242 --> 00:08:47.796
Samuel Pierpont Langley

187
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.796
was given 50,000 dollars by the War Department

188
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.796
to figure out this flying machine.

189
00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.391
Money was no problem.

190
00:08:54.415 --> 00:08:56.796
He held a seat at Harvard

191
00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.820
and worked at the Smithsonian and was extremely well-connected;

192
00:08:59.844 --> 00:09:01.796
he knew all the big minds of the day.

193
00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.796
He hired the best minds money could find

194
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.796
and the market conditions were fantastic.

195
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.796
The New York Times followed him around everywhere,

196
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.796
and everyone was rooting for Langley.

197
00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.808
Then how come we've never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley?

198
00:09:16.305 --> 00:09:18.446
A few hundred miles away in Dayton Ohio,

199
00:09:19.399 --> 00:09:20.796
Orville and Wilbur Wright,

200
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.796
they had none of what we consider to be the recipe for success.

201
00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.796
They had no money;

202
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.059
they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop;

203
00:09:30.083 --> 00:09:32.369
not a single person on the Wright brothers' team

204
00:09:32.393 --> 00:09:33.796
had a college education,

205
00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.796
not even Orville or Wilbur;

206
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.796
and The New York Times followed them around nowhere.

207
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.796
The difference was,

208
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.796
Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause, by a purpose, by a belief.

209
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.796
They believed that if they could figure out this flying machine,

210
00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.617
it'll change the course of the world.

211
00:09:52.204 --> 00:09:54.153
Samuel Pierpont Langley was different.

212
00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:56.796
He wanted to be rich, and he wanted to be famous.

213
00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.796
He was in pursuit of the result.

214
00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.796
He was in pursuit of the riches.

215
00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.774
And lo and behold, look what happened.

216
00:10:02.798 --> 00:10:06.344
The people who believed in the Wright brothers' dream

217
00:10:06.368 --> 00:10:08.796
worked with them with blood and sweat and tears.

218
00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.796
The others just worked for the paycheck.

219
00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.015
They tell stories of how every time the Wright brothers went out,

220
00:10:14.039 --> 00:10:16.046
they would have to take five sets of parts,

221
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.084
because that's how many times they would crash before supper.

222
00:10:20.486 --> 00:10:24.503
And, eventually, on December 17th, 1903,

223
00:10:24.527 --> 00:10:26.796
the Wright brothers took flight,

224
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.868
and no one was there to even experience it.

225
00:10:28.892 --> 00:10:30.971
We found out about it a few days later.

226
00:10:32.574 --> 00:10:36.597
And further proof that Langley was motivated by the wrong thing:

227
00:10:36.621 --> 00:10:38.955
The day the Wright brothers took flight,

228
00:10:38.979 --> 00:10:39.980
he quit.

229
00:10:40.004 --> 00:10:41.796
He could have said,

230
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.796
"That's an amazing discovery, guys,

231
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.796
and I will improve upon your technology," but he didn't.

232
00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:50.411
He wasn't first, he didn't get rich, he didn't get famous, so he quit.

233
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.030
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.

234
00:10:54.054 --> 00:10:55.796
If you talk about what you believe,

235
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.796
you will attract those who believe what you believe.

236
00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.154
But why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe?

237
00:11:04.224 --> 00:11:06.777
Something called the law of diffusion of innovation,

238
00:11:06.801 --> 00:11:09.311
if you don't know the law, you know the terminology.

239
00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:13.796
The first 2.5% of our population are our innovators.

240
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:18.033
The next 13.5% of our population are our early adopters.

241
00:11:19.072 --> 00:11:20.916
The next 34% are your early majority,

242
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.273
your late majority and your laggards.

243
00:11:24.265 --> 00:11:26.796
The only reason these people buy touch-tone phones

244
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.059
is because you can't buy rotary phones anymore.

245
00:11:29.083 --> 00:11:30.796
(Laughter)

246
00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.796
We all sit at various places at various times on this scale,

247
00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.796
but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us

248
00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:41.796
is that if you want mass-market success or mass-market acceptance of an idea,

249
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.796
you cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point

250
00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.796
between 15 and 18 percent market penetration,

251
00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.796
and then the system tips.

252
00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.065
I love asking businesses, "What's your conversion on new business?"

253
00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:57.722
They love to tell you, "It's about 10 percent," proudly.

254
00:11:57.746 --> 00:11:59.889
Well, you can trip over 10% of the customers.

255
00:11:59.913 --> 00:12:01.859
We all have about 10% who just "get it."

256
00:12:01.883 --> 00:12:03.596
That's how we describe them, right?

257
00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.097
That's like that gut feeling, "Oh, they just get it."

258
00:12:06.121 --> 00:12:08.557
The problem is: How do you find the ones that get it

259
00:12:08.581 --> 00:12:11.225
before doing business versus the ones who don't get it?

260
00:12:11.249 --> 00:12:14.796
So it's this here, this little gap that you have to close,

261
00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.201
as Jeffrey Moore calls it, "Crossing the Chasm" --

262
00:12:17.225 --> 00:12:20.796
because, you see, the early majority will not try something

263
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:24.796
until someone else has tried it first.

264
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.796
And these guys, the innovators and the early adopters,

265
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.011
they're comfortable making those gut decisions.

266
00:12:30.035 --> 00:12:32.796
They're more comfortable making those intuitive decisions

267
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.796
that are driven by what they believe about the world

268
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.796
and not just what product is available.

269
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.467
These are the people who stood in line for six hours

270
00:12:41.491 --> 00:12:43.627
to buy an iPhone when they first came out,

271
00:12:43.651 --> 00:12:46.796
when you could have bought one off the shelf the next week.

272
00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.963
These are the people who spent 40,000 dollars

273
00:12:48.987 --> 00:12:51.796
on flat-screen TVs when they first came out,

274
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.129
even though the technology was substandard.

275
00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:58.796
And, by the way, they didn't do it because the technology was so great;

276
00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.796
they did it for themselves.

277
00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.796
It's because they wanted to be first.

278
00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.297
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it

279
00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:08.796
and what you do simply proves what you believe.

280
00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:12.796
In fact, people will do the things that prove what they believe.

281
00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:17.796
The reason that person bought the iPhone in the first six hours,

282
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.796
stood in line for six hours,

283
00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.201
was because of what they believed about the world,

284
00:13:22.225 --> 00:13:24.225
and how they wanted everybody to see them:

285
00:13:24.249 --> 00:13:25.281
They were first.

286
00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:27.796
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.

287
00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.796
So let me give you a famous example,

288
00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:34.383
a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation.

289
00:13:34.407 --> 00:13:35.796
First, the famous failure.

290
00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.796
It's a commercial example.

291
00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.057
As we said before, the recipe for success

292
00:13:40.081 --> 00:13:43.473
is money and the right people and the right market conditions.

293
00:13:43.497 --> 00:13:45.242
You should have success then.

294
00:13:45.266 --> 00:13:46.796
Look at TiVo.

295
00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.535
From the time TiVo came out about eight or nine years ago

296
00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:50.797
to this current day,

297
00:13:50.821 --> 00:13:54.471
they are the single highest-quality product on the market,

298
00:13:54.495 --> 00:13:56.368
hands down, there is no dispute.

299
00:13:57.415 --> 00:13:59.222
They were extremely well-funded.

300
00:13:59.246 --> 00:14:00.945
Market conditions were fantastic.

301
00:14:00.969 --> 00:14:02.796
I mean, we use TiVo as verb.

302
00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:06.079
I TiVo stuff on my piece-of-junk Time Warner DVR all the time.

303
00:14:06.103 --> 00:14:08.146
(Laughter)

304
00:14:08.619 --> 00:14:10.796
But TiVo's a commercial failure.

305
00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:12.796
They've never made money.

306
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.796
And when they went IPO,

307
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.796
their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars

308
00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.249
and then plummeted, and it's never traded above 10.

309
00:14:19.273 --> 00:14:21.796
In fact, I don't think it's even traded above six,

310
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.796
except for a couple of little spikes.

311
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.154
Because you see, when TiVo launched their product,

312
00:14:26.178 --> 00:14:28.796
they told us all what they had.

313
00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:32.274
They said, "We have a product that pauses live TV,

314
00:14:32.298 --> 00:14:36.796
skips commercials, rewinds live TV and memorizes your viewing habits

315
00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.609
without you even asking."

316
00:14:39.995 --> 00:14:41.796
And the cynical majority said,

317
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.796
"We don't believe you.

318
00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.368
We don't need it. We don't like it.

319
00:14:46.392 --> 00:14:47.455
You're scaring us."

320
00:14:48.511 --> 00:14:49.796
What if they had said,

321
00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:54.796
"If you're the kind of person who likes to have total control

322
00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.796
over every aspect of your life,

323
00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:00.796
boy, do we have a product for you.

324
00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.798
It pauses live TV, skips commercials,

325
00:15:02.822 --> 00:15:04.982
memorizes your viewing habits, etc., etc."

326
00:15:05.678 --> 00:15:08.192
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it,

327
00:15:08.216 --> 00:15:11.577
and what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe.

328
00:15:12.379 --> 00:15:16.423
Now let me give you a successful example of the law of diffusion of innovation.

329
00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:20.796
In the summer of 1963,

330
00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.796
250,000 people showed up on the mall in Washington

331
00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.472
to hear Dr. King speak.

332
00:15:27.974 --> 00:15:30.796
They sent out no invitations,

333
00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.796
and there was no website to check the date.

334
00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.796
How do you do that?

335
00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.963
Well, Dr. King wasn't the only man in America

336
00:15:37.987 --> 00:15:40.390
who was a great orator.

337
00:15:40.414 --> 00:15:42.580
He wasn't the only man in America who suffered

338
00:15:42.604 --> 00:15:44.382
in a pre-civil rights America.

339
00:15:44.406 --> 00:15:46.796
In fact, some of his ideas were bad.

340
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:47.843
But he had a gift.

341
00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:52.051
He didn't go around telling people what needed to change in America.

342
00:15:52.075 --> 00:15:54.392
He went around and told people what he believed.

343
00:15:54.416 --> 00:15:57.796
"I believe, I believe, I believe," he told people.

344
00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:00.351
And people who believed what he believed

345
00:16:00.375 --> 00:16:03.796
took his cause, and they made it their own, and they told people.

346
00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:05.868
And some of those people created structures

347
00:16:05.892 --> 00:16:08.387
to get the word out to even more people.

348
00:16:08.411 --> 00:16:11.796
And lo and behold, 250,000 people showed up

349
00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:16.066
on the right day at the right time to hear him speak.

350
00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.322
How many of them showed up for him?

351
00:16:21.139 --> 00:16:22.171
Zero.

352
00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.796
They showed up for themselves.

353
00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:27.522
It's what they believed about America

354
00:16:27.546 --> 00:16:29.796
that got them to travel in a bus for eight hours

355
00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.796
to stand in the sun in Washington in the middle of August.

356
00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.868
It's what they believed, and it wasn't about black versus white:

357
00:16:35.892 --> 00:16:38.205
25% of the audience was white.

358
00:16:39.217 --> 00:16:42.820
Dr. King believed that there are two types of laws in this world:

359
00:16:42.844 --> 00:16:46.796
those that are made by a higher authority and those that are made by men.

360
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.796
And not until all the laws that are made by men

361
00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.613
are consistent with the laws made by the higher authority

362
00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:54.573
will we live in a just world.

363
00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:57.012
It just so happened that the Civil Rights Movement

364
00:16:57.036 --> 00:17:00.796
was the perfect thing to help him bring his cause to life.

365
00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.796
We followed, not for him, but for ourselves.

366
00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:06.121
By the way, he gave the "I have a dream" speech,

367
00:17:06.145 --> 00:17:08.130
not the "I have a plan" speech.

368
00:17:08.154 --> 00:17:11.796
(Laughter)

369
00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:15.011
Listen to politicians now, with their comprehensive 12-point plans.

370
00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:16.796
They're not inspiring anybody.

371
00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:19.796
Because there are leaders and there are those who lead.

372
00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:23.796
Leaders hold a position of power or authority,

373
00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:26.820
but those who lead inspire us.

374
00:17:28.353 --> 00:17:30.704
Whether they're individuals or organizations,

375
00:17:30.728 --> 00:17:33.796
we follow those who lead, not because we have to,

376
00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.657
but because we want to.

377
00:17:36.605 --> 00:17:41.043
We follow those who lead, not for them, but for ourselves.

378
00:17:42.304 --> 00:17:44.796
And it's those who start with "why"

379
00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:49.560
that have the ability to inspire those around them

380
00:17:49.584 --> 00:17:51.795
or find others who inspire them.

381
00:17:53.036 --> 00:17:54.200
Thank you very much.

382
00:17:54.224 --> 00:17:55.820
(Applause)
